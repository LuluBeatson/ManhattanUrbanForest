# Welcome

This is a duplicate of my entry into DataCamp's _City Trees_ competition.

## How do I view this project?

1. With GitHub Pages: https://lulubeatson.github.io/ManhattanUrbanForest/notebook
2. As a [published](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/de46d270-9f0e-4728-9e52-ac0eb5bb9497) workspace on DataCamp. It is a nicer viewing experience and you can upvote/comment there. But  I have "hidden" the code cells in that version.
3. Clone this repository or read the notebook rendered by Github here: [`notebook.ipynb`](https://github.com/LuluBeatson/ManhattanUrbanForest/blob/master/notebook.ipynb)
