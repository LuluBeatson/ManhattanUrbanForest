# Welcome

This is a duplicate of my entry into DataCamp's _City Trees_ competition.

## How do I view this project?

1.  The [published version of `notebook.ipynb`](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/de46d270-9f0e-4728-9e52-ac0eb5bb9497) on DataCamp is a nice viewing experience but 
I have "hidden" the code cells in that version.
2. This repository is an easier way to browse the code without making a DataCamp account.  
You can clone it or read the notebook rendered by Github here: [`notebook.ipynb`](https://github.com/LuluBeatson/ManhattanUrbanForest/blob/master/notebook.ipynb) but note that some features such as
toggles may not work.
